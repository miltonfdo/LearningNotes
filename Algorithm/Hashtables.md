**HASHTables**

Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects. Some examples of how hashing is used in our lives include:

- In universities, each student is assigned a unique roll number that can be used to retrieve information about them.
- In libraries, each book is assigned a unique number that can be used to determine information about the book, such as its exact position in the library or the users it has been     issued to etc.
- In both these examples the students and books were hashed to a unique number.
